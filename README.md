# Hi,I'm Darrel!
I'm a **System Administrator and Cybersecurity Professional** actively pivoting into a role as an **AI Cloud Engineer**.
My portfolio focuses on practical, real-world projects that demonstrate my skills in automation, cloud architecture, and systems-level problem-solving. I am passionate about building, securing, and optimizing the infrastructure that powers modern AI and cloud-native applications.

## 👨‍💻 Projects
Here are a few case studies of my work.

### 1. Hybrid AI Orchestration for Complex Research
* **Project Link:** [View the Case Study](./projects/hybrid-ai-workflow.md)
* **Summary:** Architected a "Senior/Junior" AI workflow to solve a complex research task. This system overcomes the individual cost and technical limits (session quotas, context windows) of modern AI models by orchestrating them into a single, resilient, and cost-effective process.
* **Key Technologies:** Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Python, Git, Prompt Engineering, Systems Architecture

### 2. Automated Monitoring & Self-Healing for AWS Agents
* **Project Link:** [View the Case Study](./projects/aws-agent-self-heal.md)
* **Summary:** Designed and deployed an event-driven, self-healing system on AWS to ensure 100% data-collection uptime for critical EC2 services. This project involved deep troubleshooting of IAM, network, and agent-level "red herrings" to identify and resolve a root-cause configuration conflict.
* **Key Technologies:** AWS CloudFormation (IaC), AWS Lambda (Python), Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon SNS, AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
